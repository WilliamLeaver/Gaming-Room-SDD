# Gaming Room Software-Design-Document
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room client had plans for many games the user can get to via their servers. They wanted us to build a game that would integrate into their system called Draw it or Lose it. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I believe that the earlier portion of this document is the strongest part 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- By having a design document it was easy to identify what the constraints were. This helped develop code that met all the requirements the first time. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- The final portion of the document is what I would revize. I would improve it by looking at other games that are deployed similarly to Draw it or Lose it in order to get compare and contrast possible solutions. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- By clearly developing design constraints and double checking that you have everything before developing is the best way to ensure you are meeting the user's needs. The user is the one that is going to be using the software so their input is what matters most. If the user cannot use the program then why even spend the time developing it?

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- I designed the software to meet all of the requirements first then worked through possible improvements. I believe that using a SCRUM style application to designing the software is beneficial as you would add features on one by one. This allows for a more stable program and can add flexibility to the process.
